      <h3 class="text">1. Definition of money laundering</h3>
      <p class="nd">
        Modern society currently faces a serious challenge in preventing money
        laundering, e.g. making the possession, use, or disposal of money or
        other property obtained from criminal activities appear to be legal, and
        terrorism financing - providing or gathering money or rendering
        financial services with the knowledge that the money is intended to
        finance the organization, preparation for, or execution of terrorist
        acts or to support a criminal society (criminal organization) created or
        being created to perform terrorist acts.<br><br>
        Individuals and legal entities
        whose income is earned illegally make various attempts to legalize their
        income. For example, they may use other people's personal data,
        including data that has been acquired fraudulently. This may become a
        problem for people who become victims of fraud and are uninvolved in
        these parties' criminal activities

      <h3 class="text">2. Laws against money laundering</h3>
      <p class="nd">
        To prevent money laundering, organizations performing operations with
        money or other property are obligated to comply with anti-money
        laundering laws, verify the identity of clients, and assist government
        agencies and financial organizations working to combat money laundering.
        JSC Markets does everything required to ensure compliance with laws
        against money laundering and financing terrorism.

        is performed during registration, various types of non-trading
        operations, and as part of monitoring by our specialists. In order to

        The personal data we receive is handled in accordance with the
        provisions of the Privacy Agreement. Please note that the reason for the
        identification procedure is to comply with laws against money laundering
        and financing terrorism, not because we suspect you of committing

        steps is necessary to effectively combat money laundering and financing
        terrorism.
